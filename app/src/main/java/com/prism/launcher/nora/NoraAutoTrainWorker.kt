/**
 * Unattended retraining while the phone is idle.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately narrow, and every condition is checked twice -- once when scheduling,
 * once again in [doWork] -- because a periodic request survives reboots and setting changes, so
 * by the time a run fires the world may not look the way it did when it was enqueued.
 *
 * WHY IDLE, SPECIFICALLY. Training is the most expensive thing Prism does: every core busy,
 * a partial wake lock held, and a checkpoint written each epoch. Running that while the user is
 * holding the phone would be felt immediately as heat and dropped frames.
 * [Constraints.Builder.setRequiresDeviceIdle] is the system's own definition of "not in use" and
 * is the right one to defer to rather than inventing a heuristic from screen state.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT TRAIN HERE. The work is handed to [NoraService] rather than run in this
 * worker. One owner for the brain is the whole reason that service exists -- the connectome is a
 * single shared object with mutable weights, and a worker training concurrently with a chat
 * generation would corrupt both. The service already refuses overlapping work, holds the wake
 * lock, and posts the progress notification, so there is nothing to gain by duplicating it here
 * and a real invariant to lose.
 *
 * THE FOREGROUND-SERVICE CAVEAT. From Android 12 an app in the background usually cannot start a
 * foreground service, and a WorkManager job does not by itself grant an exemption. Exemption
 * comes from the battery-optimization allowlist, which Nora's training screen already prompts
 * for and which overnight training needs regardless. If it has not been granted, the start
 * throws and this returns a retry rather than failing silently, so the run is not simply lost.
