/**
 * Numerical tripwire.
 *
 * Nora trains with local rules and no framework underneath, so there is nothing watching for
 * divergence. The first version of this project found that out the hard way: an oversized
 * learning step drove the weights to Infinity, the resulting NaNs were silently converted to
 * zeros by the metabolic tax in IT, and the whole system went on producing plausible-looking
 * black images and polite "I haven't seen that" replies for two full training runs. The only
 * visible symptom was a NaN in the log that was easy to read as cosmetic.
 *
 * A failure that produces clean-looking output is worse than a crash. This object exists so
 * that never happens again: the first non-finite value anywhere records where it came from,
 * training aborts on it, and the message says what to do.
