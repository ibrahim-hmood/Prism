/**
 * Ascending neuromodulatory systems: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine.
 *
 * The organizing idea is Yu & Dayan's (2005) distinction between two kinds of uncertainty and
 * the two transmitters that signal them:
 *
 *   ACETYLCHOLINE  — EXPECTED uncertainty. The world is noisy in a way the model already knows
 *                    about. ACh raises the gain on prediction-error units, so bottom-up
 *                    evidence is weighted more heavily relative to top-down expectation.
 *                    Physiologically this matches ACh's suppression of intracortical feedback
 *                    while sparing thalamocortical drive (Hasselmo & McGaughy 2004).
 *
 *   NORADRENALINE  — UNEXPECTED uncertainty. Something has changed that the model has no
 *                    account of. NE drives a network RESET (Bouret & Sara 2005): the current
 *                    hypothesis is abandoned rather than incrementally corrected. In Nora this
 *                    is a partial wipe of the representation, forcing inference to restart from
 *                    the sensory evidence instead of grinding on a hypothesis that has already
 *                    failed. This is the mechanism that stops generation from getting stuck.
 *
 *   DOPAMINE       — reward prediction error (Schultz, Dayan & Montague 1997). Nora uses it as
 *                    a learning-rate modulator, not as a reinforcement signal in the RL sense:
 *                    examples that reduce error more than expected are learned from harder.
 *
 * HONESTY FLAG: the mapping from "one scalar per transmitter" to real neuromodulation is
 * coarse to the point of caricature. These systems have topographically differentiated
 * projections, multiple receptor subtypes with opposite effects, and timescales spanning
 * milliseconds to hours. Yu & Dayan's framework is a computational-level theory, and Nora
 * implements the computational level only. Nothing here should be read as a claim about basal
 * forebrain or locus coeruleus physiology.
