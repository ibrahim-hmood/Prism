/**
 * Anterior temporal lobe: the amodal semantic hub.
 *
 * The hub-and-spoke model (Patterson, Nestor & Rogers 2007; Lambon Ralph et al. 2017) holds
 * that modality-specific "spokes" -- visual, auditory, verbal, motor -- converge on a
 * transmodal hub in the anterior temporal lobes, where they form representations that are not
 * tied to any one modality. The evidence is semantic dementia: bilateral ATL atrophy degrades
 * conceptual knowledge across every modality at once, which is not what damage to a
 * modality-specific store would do.
 *
 * Nora needs exactly this, for a concrete reason: a text prompt has to become a visual
 * hypothesis, and the two live in different representational spaces. The hub is where they
 * meet. Words drive the hub, the hub drives IT, and IT's activity is what the generative
 * hierarchy unrolls into an image.
 *
 * The association is bidirectional and Hebbian. During training, the caption's word pattern and
 * the settled IT pattern are simultaneously active, so the synapses between them potentiate --
 * "cells that fire together, wire together" (Hebb 1949) in its most literal form. During
 * generation the association runs the other way: words alone reinstate the visual pattern.
 *
 * HONESTY FLAG: the lexical front end is a hashed bag of words with character-trigram backoff.
 * It has no syntax, no compositionality, and no word-order sensitivity. "A dog chasing a cat"
 * and "a cat chasing a dog" produce identical hub patterns. Real ATL semantics is
 * compositional and this is not; it is a lookup keyed by content words. Fixing this properly
 * means a syntactic binding mechanism Nora does not have, and it is the single largest
 * capability gap versus a text-conditioned diffusion model with a real text encoder. Phase 3
 * in NORA.md addresses it.
