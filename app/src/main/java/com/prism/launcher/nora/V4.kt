/**
 * V4: shape parts, colour constancy, and surface binding.
 *
 *  1. CURVATURE AND SHAPE-PART TUNING. Pasupathy & Connor (1999, 2001, 2002) showed V4 neurons
 *     are tuned jointly to boundary CURVATURE and to the ANGULAR POSITION of that curvature
 *     relative to the object's centre of mass -- not to whole shapes, and not to simple
 *     orientation. A moderately-curved convexity at the upper right is a different stimulus to
 *     a V4 cell than the same convexity at the lower left. Nora implements exactly that basis:
 *     a (curvature x angular-position) grid, referenced to a computed object centroid.
 *
 *  2. COLOUR CONSTANCY. V4 was originally characterized by Zeki (1983) as responding to
 *     perceived rather than measured colour. Implemented as von Kries (1902) adaptation --
 *     each opponent channel divided by its own spatial mean, which discounts the illuminant.
 *     Simple, but it is the mechanism the perceptual literature keeps returning to
 *     (Foster 2011 reviews why).
 *
 *  3. SURFACE / FIGURE BINDING. Brightness and colour spread across a region and stop at its
 *     borders (Paradiso & Nakayama 1991; Komatsu 2006). Implemented as anisotropic diffusion
 *     whose conductance is gated by V2 border-ownership signals: colour flows freely inside a
 *     figure and is blocked at an owned boundary. This is what turns a sparse set of contour
 *     responses back into filled regions, and it is the step that makes generated images look
 *     like objects rather than wireframes.
 *
 * HONESTY FLAG: the curvature basis is fitted, not learned. Pasupathy & Connor derived their
 * basis by fitting responses to a stimulus set; Nora installs the resulting tuning functions
 * directly. Whether V4 arrives at this basis through experience or through the statistics of
 * its V2 input is not settled.
