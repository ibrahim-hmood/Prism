/**
 * Process-wide training state, owned by [NoraTrainingService] and observed by the UI.
 *
 * The activity cannot own any of this. An overnight run has to survive the screen turning off,
 * the activity being destroyed to reclaim memory, and the user coming back hours later expecting
 * to see where things got to. So the log, the progress, and the run flag all live here, outside
 * any Activity lifecycle, and the UI is a pure observer that can be torn down and rebuilt at any
 * point without interrupting anything.
 *
 * The log replays, so a recreated activity immediately repaints the history rather than showing
 * an empty pane next to a service that is clearly still working.
